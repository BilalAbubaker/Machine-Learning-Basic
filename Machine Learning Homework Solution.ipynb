    "# Questions for Scenario 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Why is this a binary classification problem and not regression?\n",
    "answer1 = \"\"\"\n",
    "This is a binary classification problem because the outcome or target \n",
    "variable has only two possible states (e.g., 'yes' or 'no', 'success' or 'failure', 'positive' or 'negative').\n",
    " Unlike regression, where the output is a continuous variable that can take on a wide range of values,\n",
    " binary classification restricts the output to two discrete categories. In this scenario, \n",
    "we are likely trying to predict one of two possible outcomes rather than a continuous value.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What additional features might be useful?\n",
    "answer2 = \"\"\"\n",
    "Additional features that could be useful would depend on the specific scenario but might include\n",
    " temporal data (e.g., time of day, seasonality), user-specific information (e.g., age, demographics), \n",
    "behavioral patterns (e.g., past user actions or engagement levels), \n",
    "or context-related variables (e.g., location or device type). Incorporating these features could improve the model's \n",
    "ability to make more nuanced predictions.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. How would you measure the success of this model?\n",
    "answer3 = \"\"\"\n",
    "Success for a binary classification model can be measured using metrics such as accuracy, \n",
    "precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Which metric is prioritized depends on the context: for example, \n",
    "if false positives are more costly, precision might be more important, while if false negatives are more critical, \n",
    "recall would be prioritized. In many cases, AUC-ROC provides a balanced view of the model's performance across different thresholds.\n",

    "Logistic regression is a simple and interpretable model that works well for binary outcomes. \n",
    "Decision trees and ensemble methods like random forests or gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost) are also popular,\n",
    " as they can handle complex relationships between features and often yield high accuracy. For large datasets with potentially complex patterns, deep learning models, \n",
    " such as neural networks, may be considered. The choice depends on factors like interpretability needs, dataset size, and complexity of the relationships between features.\n",

    "# 1. What makes fraud detection particularly challenging?\n",
    "answer1b = \"\"\"\n",
    "Fraud detection is challenging due to several factors.\n",
    " First, fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate ones,\n",
    " leading to highly imbalanced data. Fraud patterns also evolve over time, as fraudsters adapt to detection methods,\n",
    " requiring models that can adapt or be frequently retrained. Additionally, fraudulent behaviors are complex \n",
    "and can involve subtle or hidden patterns, making it difficult for simple models to accurately capture them.\n",
    " Lastly, false positives are costly, as flagging legitimate transactions as fraudulent can frustrate customers,\n",

    "\n",
    "# 2. How would you handle class imbalance in this scenario?\n",
    "answer2b = \"\"\"\n",
    "To handle class imbalance in fraud detection, several approaches could be applied. \n",
    "One option is to use resampling techniques, such as oversampling the minority class (e.g., SMOTE) or undersampling \n",
    "the majority class, to balance the dataset. Another approach is to apply algorithms that can handle imbalanced data,\n",
    " like ensemble methods or anomaly detection models, which can focus more on identifying rare events.\n",
    " Additionally, using evaluation metrics like precision, recall,\n",

    "Using multiple output regression allows us to predict several related outputs simultaneously in a single model,\n",

The goal is to identify which buses are likely to arrive late at their next stop, allowing operators to make adjustments and inform passengers in advance.\n",

    "Solution Choice: Classification or Regression?\n",
    "In this scenario, we could approach the problem using either classification or regression:\n",

This simplifies the output, allowing us to focus on whether a delay is likely or not. Classification would be a suitable choice if the main goal is simply to identify if a delay will happen, without needing the exact duration of the delay.\n",

    "Regression: Alternatively, we could use regression to predict the specific delay time (e.g., in minutes) for each bus at its next stop. This approach provides a more granular output, which is beneficial if the city wants precise estimates of delay times to make more targeted adjustments or inform passengers about exact wait times.\n",

    "I would recommend classification in this scenario, specifically a binary classification model predicting \"On Time\" or \"Delayed,\" for the following reasons:\n",

    "Simplicity of Output: In most cases, passengers and operators may only need to know if the bus will be late, rather than the exact number of minutes delayed. This makes classification a practical choice.\n",
